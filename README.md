## Key Concepts

### 1. The Fundamental Cloud Compute Model

Most modern IT systems are based on the client-server model. In AWS:
- **Clients** request computing resources or data
- **Servers** (implemented as EC2 instances or other managed services) process these requests and respond accordingly

An understanding of these components forms the groundwork for building and scaling applications in the cloud.

### 2. AWS Foundational Principle: Pay Only for What You Use

Unlike traditional on-premises data centers, where you must predict resource needs and often over-purchase hardware, AWS uses a flexible pay-as-you-go pricing model:

- No need to pre-allocate (or pay for) unused capacity
- Instantly provision resources when needed and terminate them as demand drops
- Better cost efficiency and scalability for your business
